To compile on Gentoo:


+ Use python2.7, not 3.x.

+ When you get undefined references to GOMP_.* and omp.* symbols, add
  '-lgomp' (without the quotes) to:

  build-linux-x86_64-release/newview/CMakeFiles/secondlife-bin.dir/link.txt
  build-linux-x86_64-release/llplugin/slplugin/CMakeFiles/SLPlugin.dir/link.txt

+ You may get messages about 'libwebkit_pluin' failing.  I don't know
  how to fix that.
